# About
This repo contains the source code for my explore 2.0 project, an improved version of Scratch's explore page.

Until 01/01/2024, explore 2.0 was available at https://timmccool.tim1de.net/explore/projects/all. Because replit discontinued free dynamic hosting, the project was shut down down.

# Features
- Updates multiple times every day
- Features trending projects (based on loves / time. the actual formula is more complex)
- Not depending on Scratch's indexer
- Less glitchy than Scratch's explore page
- Tags in the description have the same priority as title tags
